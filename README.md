A crossword puzzle program (making, not solving)


  When I was a kid, my grandpa taught me how to do crossword puzzles, and solving them eventually became one of my favorite hobbies. In fact, the reason I started learning Python was to write a program to help me create my own puzzle.
  
  Although I originally intended to write an algorithm that would fit words from a dictionary into a grid, I realized that the more interesting (and less attempted) challenge here is to use natural language processing (NLP) tools to generate clues.
  
  My program does a few things:
    1. Randomly generate a grid of a given size (that follows all the rules for NYT puzzle grids)
    2. Fits words from a dictionary list into the grid
    3. Clues all of the generated words, using an amalgamation of ~10 clue functions
    
  I'm excited to contine to expand the quality and variety of clues as I continue to learn and as the field of NLP progresses!
